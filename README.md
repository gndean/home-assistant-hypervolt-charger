# home-assistant-hypervolt-charger

A [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Custom Component integration for the [Hypervolt electric vehicle (EV) charger](https://hypervolt.co.uk/). This integration replicates functionality of the Hypervolt mobile app and allows actions to be automated and data to be logged within Home Assistant.

- Start or stop charging based on the cheapest half hour slots available within your agile electricity tariff
- Automatically manage charging when excess solar is available and your home storage battery is full (Super Eco mode alone may not work as you'd like when a home battery is installed)
- Ensure that your charger is configured for the night's charge, every night, no matter what settings were changed during the day e.g. Scheduled Charge mode on, max current set, Boost mode set, ready to charge
- Stop charging when a specific amount of energy has been supplied, or specific state of charge is reached (assuming the EV's state of charge is available via some other integration)
- ...

# Is this official?

This integration is not officially supported by Hypervolt and has been independently developed. Hypervolt are however aware of the integration and appear happy for it to exist.

# Installation

The easy way to set up is to install through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). After installation via HACS and reboot of Home-Assistant, this integration can be added through the integration setup UI, like any other integration: Settings / Integrations / Add New Integration.

# Use

Once installed within Home Assistant, and having restarted Home Assistant, you should be able to add the Hypervolt Charger integration. You'll be asked for your Hypervolt account credentials then the integration should find your charger and create a Device with the name of your charger's serial number. The various entities can then be added to dashboards, automations etc. as you wish.

# Synchronisation model

The integration uses the hypervolt.co.uk APIs so is dependent on the cloud. Most of the settings are updated via websocket pushes so changes are reflected to/from the integration near immediately. An exception is the Activation Mode. For this, and as a fallback in case a push message is missed, the integration also polls the Hypervolt APIs every 5 minutes to refresh the state.

# Entities

The integration is intended to match the features of the iOS and Android apps.

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Hypervolt Charging | Shows the current charging state. Used to matches the big Charging switch in the app when this existed. | ‚ö†Ô∏è The entity will be turned into a read-only sensor in a future release, as the HV app no longer supports the stopping of charging via a switch (instead change the Activation Mode) |
| Hypervolt Charging Readiness | One of: `Charging`, `Ready`, `Not Ready - Force Stopped`. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated. Was added when the HV app had a charging switch that allowed charging to be stopped by toggling the switch. But then lead to a gotcha where charging would not resume. This entity will be removed in a future release.|
| Hypervolt Car Plugged | Indicates whether the car is currently plugged into the charger. | ‚ö†Ô∏è V3 chargers only. |
| Hypervolt Lock State | Matches the lock feature in the app and allows locking of the charger. The `Lock Pending` state is mapped to `On`. | |
| Hypervolt Activation Mode | Switches between `Plug and Charge` and `Schedule Charge` modes. | Use to start/stop charging. ‚ö†Ô∏èChanges to this setting are not always reflected in realtime within the integration or Hypervolt app. If changed externally to the integration its state should update to the correct state within 5 minutes. |
| Hypervolt Charge Mode | Switches between `Boost`, `Eco`, and `Super Eco` modes. | |
| Hypervolt Charger Name | The user-defined name for the charger. Can be read and updated. | This name is stored on the charger itself and will be reflected in the Hypervolt mobile app. |
| Hypervolt Max Current | Reads and sets the maximum charging current, in Amps. | |
| Hypervolt LED Brightness | Reads and sets the LED brightness, in percent, as available via Settings within the app. | The LED Mode isn't currently supported by the integration. |
| Hypervolt Schedule Session (n) Start/End Time | Represents the schedule start/end time for the given session number. The values are populated from the Hypervolt servers and then can be modified within Home Assistant. | Session times are not changed until the `Apply Schedule` button is pressed. This allows start and end times to be modified individually and all changes applied at once, to avoid invalid or undesirable schedules being applied while interim changes are being made. To delete a session, set the start and the end time to be the same value. Once applied, the session will be removed. |
| Hypervolt Schedule Session (n) Charg Mode | The charging mode for the session slot | ‚ö†Ô∏èV3 chargers only. Sessions not changed until the `Apply Schedule` button is pressed. |
| Hypervolt Apply Schedule button | Press this button to apply the schedule session start and end times. Once successfully applied, the session times are read back from the API. This may cause the session time values to update, for example, any gaps in the sessions will be removed i.e. if session 1 and session 3 were populated only, once applied, session 1 and session 2 would be populated. Also any sessions where the start time equals the end time will be removed. | Applying the session times does not automatically switch the Hypervolt into Schedule mode. For that, use the `Activation Mode` select. |
| EV Power, House Power, Grid Power, Generation Power | Power usage derived from the CT clamp(s), as reported by the Hypervolt app. | For V3 devices, these values are reported even when there is no charging session. For V2 devices, these are only reported during a charging session. This integration just reports the values from the Hypervolt APIs. No assurance of accuracy of the values is given! |
| Hypervolt Voltage, Hypervolt Charger Current | Only available during a charging session, these represent the voltage and current from the Hypervolt charger. | This integration just reports the values from the Hypervolt APIs. No assurance of accuracy of the values is given! |
| Hypervolt CT Current, Hypervolt CT Power | Only available during a charging session, these represent the current and power seen by the external CT clamp so will typically measure the household, or at least, whole circuit load, not just the Hypervolt. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Use EV Power now, rather than CT Power. This integration just reports the values from the Hypervolt APIs. No assurance of accuracy of the values is given! |
| Hypervolt Firmware Version | Displays the firmware version running on the charger. | The version format varies by charger model (e.g., "1234.0" for V3, "202111231810.abcdef" for V2). This is retrieved on initial connectiona and on access token refresh (approx every hour)
| Hypervolt Session Carbon Saved, Hypervolt Session ID, Hypervolt Session Energy | Are fields related to the current, or most recent charging session. | `Hypervolt Session Energy` just reports the session energy exactly from the Hypervolt APIs and resets for each new session. The value may be noisy i.e. decrease slightly during the charging session and will reset each charging session. For this reason, it is not a good choice to use for energy measurement within Home Assistant. For that, use `Hypervolt Session Energy Total Increasing` instead. |
| Hypervolt Session Energy Total Increasing | This is a sensor of state class [total_increasing](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/08/16/state_class_total/) which means that it is suitable for energy measurement within Home Assistant. Unlike `Hypervolt Session Energy`, the value is not taken directly from the Hypervolt APIs, cannot decrease during a session and will only reset on a new charging session, for which the [total_increasing](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/08/16/state_class_total/) logic will handle. For a discussion of why this sensor was created, see [Sensor provides negative value when reset (HA Energy Dashboard) #5](https://github.com/gndean/home-assistant-hypervolt-charger/issues/5) |

# Services

## Set Schedule

The Set Schedule service is intended to be used by üêô Octopus Agile users with the [Octopus Energy](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy) integration, specifically the [Target Rates](https://bottlecapdave.github.io/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/setup/target_rate/) sensors which allow you to find the cheapest periods between two times. This allows an Agile user to set the schedule on the Hypervolt rather than switching the Hypervolt on or off based on the `binary_sensor`. This hopefully avoids failed charges due to cloud or connectivity outages that may occur overnight, and allows the user to check the schedule before settling down for bed üò¥. A pseudo-intelligent automation could trigger when the car is plugged in (e.g. from a car integration), set a [dynamic target rate](https://bottlecapdave.github.io/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/services/#octopus_energyupdate_target_config) between the current time until the morning, schedule the Hypervolt for those periods, and send a notification to the phone with the intended charging periods.

It has one target and 4 parameters:

* Target Device - Your Hypervolt ID
* Tracker Rate - The binary_sensor target created by the Octopus Energy integration
* Backup Start - A backup start period if no times are found in the target sensor, consider setting this to give you enough charge to get to work and back...
* Backup End - Backup end period
* Append Backup - If checked this will always append the backup schedule period to the schedule. For example, we could set 06:00-07:00 to allow morning pre-heat climate control to draw from the grid rather than battery

The following sample yaml can be used to configure the service in an automation:

```yaml
service: hypervolt_charger.set_schedule
data:
  backup_schedule_start: "04:30:00"
  backup_schedule_end: "06:00:00"
  tracker_rate: binary_sensor.octopus_energy_target_test
  append_backup: true
target:
  device_id: HYPERVOLT_DEVICE_ID
```

It also has code to support an [intelligent_dispatching](https://bottlecapdave.github.io/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/entities/intelligent/) sensor to schedule the Hypervolt to match the `planned_dispatches` time periods. This has not been tested yet, but could be useful for owners with two cars and two chargers that want to set the second car to match the first car that is on the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff, or potentially Intelligent Octopus Flux or any other Intelligent stuff Octopus comes out with.
